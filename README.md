# [Actionable Ideas](http://ideas.edwardunthank.com)

Actionable Ideas (working title) is a communal, open-source website to submit good ideas that others can work on. Great ideas are born every day, but they're withheld by the overwhelming problem of having to act on them. This allows people to submit those ideas to the public, and the public can rally around them to take action.
