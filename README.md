# [Actionable Ideas](http://ideas.edwardunthank.com)

Actionable Ideas (working title) is a communal, open-source website to submit good ideas that others can work on. Great ideas are born every day, but they're withheld by the overwhelming problem of having to act on them. This allows people to submit those ideas to the public, and the public can rally around them to take action.

## Areas you can improve

* A new name. "Actionable Ideas" is a working title. It's for the prototype and meant to be changed, adapted, and stretched.
* Branding. Anything you see at this point is just for convenience. We need a name, a logo, colors, and front-end design.
* Front-end development. Some jQuery and other aesthetic touches would help immensely. Throw in some UI/UX improvements, too!
* Back-end development. AJAX is pretty necessary, and the MySQL tables could be better organized so they can expand. New databases and tables and rows and columns? Go right ahead. Moving away from MySQL? Whatever you want to do.
* Making the site more secure. I've included the live database's login details in the source files. This is purposeful, because everyone should be able to work on this. This is also an experiment in trust. How could we keep giving people full access while putting some security in place?
* Whatever you can think of. Submit your ideas on the page itself, and put the category as "Actionable Ideas." When there's sortable functionality, that'll be a useful way to add ideas quickly.
